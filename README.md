# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction

**Introduction**  
Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is a project focused on technical analysis, visualization, and prediction using data sourced from Yahoo Finance. By analyzing stock market data, particularly from major technology stocks and other sectors, the project leverages advanced tools to provide insights. The process involves utilizing pandas to extract stock information, visualizing various aspects of the data, and applying statistical methods to evaluate the risk of a stock based on its historical performance. The project also incorporates predictive modeling to estimate future stock prices using the Monte Carlo simulation method.  

**Purpose**  
The primary goal of this project is to comparatively evaluate the effectiveness of prediction algorithms on stock market data, gain actionable insights through visualization, and forecast future stock behavior and associated risks. By integrating concepts of Data Mining and Statistics, the project serves as a comprehensive exploration of stock market analytics. It extensively uses NumPy, Pandas, and Data Visualization Libraries to achieve these objectives.


**Idea**

The project draws inspiration from [@venky14](https://github.com/venky14). By integrating these elements, the project aims to develop advanced analytical tools and methodologies for robust stock performance evaluation and forecasting.
